# ``MahouRan``

Mahou Ran App is an application designed for the Mahou Ran café, created to enhance the experience of Senpai when visiting the café.
Its purpose is to provide convenience for every Senpai, ensuring that their visit to Mahou Ran is filled with happiness.

## Overview

The Mahou Ran App is designed to support Senpai visiting the enchanted land (the café itself), making it more convenient to place orders, receive items, and participate in the Drop system.
A Drop refers to receiving memorabilia or collectibles that witches or wizards sell or distribute before leaving the café or finishing an activity—especially items related to that specific witch or wizard. It may also involve personal items that a witch or wizard chooses to “drop” (let go of) for interested Senpai, since they will no longer use them.
The app also allows Senpai to check which witches or wizards will be at the café on specific days, ensuring the ultimate magical experience—powered by SwiftUI.
